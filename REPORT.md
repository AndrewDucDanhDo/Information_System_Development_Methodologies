### Point-of-View Statements: ###
* Relationship Managers (RMs) need a system to control call flow for inbound and outbound calls so that the amount of calls can be effectively managed.
* RMs need a system that will match RMs and end-customers according to the RM’s skills and customers profiles so that a suitable service can be provided.
* RMs need a system that segments customers into social and cultural groups according to their postcodes and surnames so that they can be matched with suitable customers and the chances of achieving a sale or providing a service is increased.
* RMs need a system that builds a profile and skill matrix based on a questionnaire so that it provides an initial RM profile for the matching technique.
* RMs need a system that targets potential buyers with outbound calls so that it can optimise its customer service.
* RMs need a system that dials numbers automatically according to a generated customer target list so that the calling and matching process is automated.
* RMs need a system that has a call routing and distribution routine so that it minimises inbound call costs by reducing per-call handling time.
* RMs need a system that calculates a skill score based on the RM’s previous call duration and profile so that RM’s can be ranked on quality of performance.
* RM’s need a system that scores a customer from 1-10 based on the likelihood to purchase the product so that customers with the highest score can be served first.
* RM’s need a system that directs customers to an Interactive Voice Response unit prompting them for options or verbal responses and then redirects the call to an Automatic Call Distributor to be matched with an RM so that during busy times, all customers can be provided service and updates on their current position in the calling queue.
* Customers need a system that redirects their customer inquiries to a suitable RM so that they can have their queries answered.

### How Might We Statements: ###
* How might we improve call routing and dynamic call flow control for both inbound and outbound calls?
* How might we segment customers into social and cultural segments according to their postcodes and surnames?
* How might we provide assistance to RMs in serving  their end-customers?
* How might we create a supporting tool to  create customer profiles?
* How might we improve who is served first?
* How might we create a questionnaire that builds an employee profile and skill matrix?
* How might we provide RM’s with guidelines and a script to help in providing improved service to the end-customer?
* How might we change the way a customer is scored?
* How might we create a target list for each RM based on their skills and profile?
* How might we ensure that our customers are always kept happy and satisfied?
* How might we direct inbound customers to an Interactive Voice Response unit / Automatic Call Distributor?
* How might we prevent customers hanging up from long wait times?
